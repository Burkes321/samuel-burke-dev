## About this project

Simple personal website made in next js which will also be used to show off my personal projects in the future

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## TODO - things I want to implement in the future

- instead of having each piece of text be an entire page, fit it in a more normal flow of a document. Remove the <Section /> approach I've gone with so far (just to be done on experience page now)
- turn the text pieces into extensible react comopnent for DRY purposes
- Once I have some personal projects done, create a section to showcase them
- responsivity down to most mobile devices (~360px width), currently works down to 1200px
- add a blog - somewhere to post thoughts about new tech, trends etc
